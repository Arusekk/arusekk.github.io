      <description>The best way to contact me is to send me an email: blog at arusekk.pl. I reply after a week at most. If it does not work, try arek_koz at o2.pl.
You can find me also on Matrix (@Arusekk:matrix.org) and Discord (@Arusekk#6609). I sometimes lag more on those, but if you are lucky and catch me online, we can talk with the least ping.</description>
