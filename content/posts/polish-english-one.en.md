description: A nice quirk I found about Polish/English translation
---

I just found while English is a strict [SVO][wiki-svo] language, Polish is not, and makes use of it. On the example of one of Henryk Krzyżanowski's excellent translation samples:

> The brass section was apparently approaching.

> Orkiestra dęta najwyraźniej się zbliżała.

But, as it appeared to me this morning, if we change 'the' into 'a', the natural translation would differ by order:

> A brass section was apparently approaching.

> Najwyraźniej zbliżała się orkiestra dęta.

The difference is way more subtle than in English, and the second one does not necessarily always mean 'a', but you should get that if you are a Polish speaker. Funny, isn't it?
