The best way to contact me is to send me an email: [`blog at arusekk.pl`](mailto:blog@arusekk.pl). I reply after a week at most.
If it does not work, try `arek_koz` at `o2.pl`.

You can find me also on Matrix (`@Arusekk:matrix.org`) and Discord (`@Arusekk#6609`).
I sometimes lag more on those, but if you are lucky and catch me online, we can talk with the least ping.
